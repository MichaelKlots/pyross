## Tutorial examples

Please have a look at the [examples folder](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples) for notebook examples.
The examples are structured along the following pipeline

![Imagel](../examples/pipeline.jpg)

The examples are classified as:

* [contactMatrix](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/contactMatrix): shows how to use contact matrix and intervention

* [control](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/control): shows how to compute time dependent contact matrix which depend of time and state

* [deterministic](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/deterministic): is for integration of equations of motion in the limit of no stochastic components

* [forecast](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/forecast): is for forecasting once the parameters are known

* [hybrid](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/hybrid): is for integration of equations of motion which can switch from deterministic to stochastic

* [inference](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/inference): shows how to infer parameters and select models given data

* [stochastic](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/stochastic): is for integration of equations of motion with stochastic components
