Please have a look at the [examples folder](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples) for notebook examples.
The examples are structured along the following pipeline

![Imagel](../examples/others/pipeline.jpg)

The examples are classified as:

* [deterministic](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/deterministic) is for integration of equations of motion in the limit of no stochastic components

* [stochastic](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/stochastic) is for integration of equations of motion with stochastic components

* [inference](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples/inference) shows how to infer parameters and select models given data
