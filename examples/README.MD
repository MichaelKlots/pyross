The examples are classified as:

* contactMatrix: shows how to compute contact matrix 

* control: shows how to compute time dependent contact matrix which depend of time and state

* deterministic: is for integration of equations of motion in the limit of no stochastic components

* forecast: is for forecasting once the parameters are known

* hybrid: is for integration of equations of motion which can switch from deterministic to stochastic

* inference: shows how to infer parameters and select models given data

* stochastic: is for integration of equations of motion with stochastic components

* tsi: is for modelling infectiousness of an infected individual as a function of time since infection
