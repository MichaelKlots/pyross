The examples are classified as:

* Deterministic: Integration of equations of motion in the limit of no stochastic components. 

* Stochastic: Integration of equations of motion with stochastic components. 

* Hybrid: Integration of equations of motion which can switch from deterministic to stochastic. 

* contactMatrix: shows how to compute contact matrix 

* control: shows how to compute time dependent contact matrix which depend of time and state. 

* inference: shows how to infer parameters and select models given data

* forecast: is for forecasting once the parameters are known
