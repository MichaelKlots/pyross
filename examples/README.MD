The examples are classified as:

* **control** shows examples of various control measures in epimodelling 

* **deterministic** is for integration of equations of motion in the limit of no stochastic components

* **forecast** is for forecasting once the parameters are known

* **inference** shows how to infer parameters and select models given data

* **stochastic** is for integration of equations of motion with stochastic components

* **others** are set of miscellaneous examples which include:
    - Hybrid simulation scheme using a combination of stochastic and deterministic schemes.
    - Simulation using time since infection models 
    - Example on how to simulate upto a steady state
