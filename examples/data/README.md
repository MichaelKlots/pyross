Contact matrix data is obtained from 

Projecting social contact matrices in 152 countries using contact surveys and demographic data (Prem-Jit-Cook)

Supplementary information file contains the contact matrices mu_ij for home, work, school and others and their sum, which is the total contact matrix. 

Populations are aggregated into 5 year bins. The maximum age is 80. Therefore, there are 16 bins. 

Data is Bayesian imputation combining POLYMOD, DHS, and ROW data. Empirical data exists for India, which is part of the DHS survey. Therefore, Bayesian imputation agrees very well with empirical data in this case. 

Contact matrices may need to be adjusted to ensure reciprocity.
